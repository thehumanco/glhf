# interview questions

To start, set up your environment below, which will download the large data files you'll need while Vincent steps you through the interview questions.
```bash
conda create -n mecha python=3.10
source setup.sh
```

Each of the interview questions is formatted as a script that you need to implement. All dependencies should be taken care of with the setup commands. You should run each script as a Python module, or
```bash
python -m questions.a1_estimate_pi
python -m questions.a2_interp1d
python -m questions.b1_dataloading
python -m questions.b2_projection
python -m questions.b3_reference_frames
```
